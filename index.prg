/*<I wrote this software about 15 years ago (around 1999); it's a simple program to register phone cable numers installations on a building. I decided to share it just as an example of a unusual language - at that time, Clipper was largelly used to write bank program routines.I think it would be a nice source do study a 'dead' program language as Clipper. Have fun!>
